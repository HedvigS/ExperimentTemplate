aboutScreenTextBheading=Language in Interaction project
aboutScreenTextBbody=Human language is one of the most complex cognitive functions that we know, and at the same time the basis of our unique human culture and social interaction. NWO Gravity Program  hyperlink to www.languageininteraction.nl Language in Interaction aims to explain the variation in both languages and linguistic skills as the similarities. How from a biological basis which seems to be the same for all people, arose such a large range of cultural differences?\n\nTo this end, the program examines the human language across the spectrum from the level of the genes to social interactions between interlocutors. Examples of possible research are genetic differences, language in the brain, evolution of language, multilingualism, birdsong, the role of world knowledge, and nonverbal behavior. It also looks at the interplay of linguistic skills with other cognitive systems, such as memory, action and cognitive control.\n\nThe research results from Language in Interaction are implemented as socially relevant applications in areas such as education and health. We do this by spreading scientific knowledge to a wider audience, designing applications (apps, serious games, or therapy) or the available free software. Other possibilities include the validation of scientific knowledge to clinical practice, or coaching researchers in setting up a start-up in which innovative products are developed based on the research.\n
