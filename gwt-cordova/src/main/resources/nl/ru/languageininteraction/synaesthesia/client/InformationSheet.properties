informationSheetText="You must know\u2014" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed "Fudge!"\n          That statute is obsolete quite!\n     Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends\n          On an ancient manorial right.\n\n     "In the matter of Treason the pig would appear\n          To have aided, but scarcely abetted:\n     While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,\n          If you grant the plea 'never indebted.'\n\n     "The fact of Desertion I will not dispute;\n          But its guilt, as I trust, is removed\n     (So far as related to the costs of this suit)\n          By the Alibi which has been proved.\n\n     "My poor client's fate now depends on your votes."\n          Here the speaker sat down in his place,\n     And directed the Judge to refer to his notes\n          And briefly to sum up the case.\n\n     But the Judge said he never had summed up before;\n          So the Snark undertook it instead,\n     And summed it so well that it came to far more\n          Than the Witnesses ever had said!\n\n     When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,\n          As the word was so puzzling to spell;\n     But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind\n          Undertaking that duty as well.\n\n     So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,\n          It was spent with the toils of the day:\n     When it said the word "GUILTY!" the Jury all groaned,\n          And some of them fainted away.\n\n     Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite\n          Too nervous to utter a word:\n     When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,\n          And the fall of a pin might be heard.\n\n     "Transportation for life" was the sentence it gave,\n          "And then to be fined forty pound."\n     The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared\n          That the phrase was not legally sound.\n\n     But their wild exultation was suddenly checked\n          When the jailer informed them, with tears,\n     Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,\n          As the pig had been dead for some years.\n\n     The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:\n          But the Snark, though a little aghast,\n     As the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted,\n          Went bellowing on to the last.\n\n     Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed\n          To grow every moment more clear:\n     Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,\n          Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.
