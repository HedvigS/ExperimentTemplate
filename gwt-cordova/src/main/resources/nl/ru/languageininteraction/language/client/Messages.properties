aboutScreenTextEbody=<p>Do you have a question about LingQuest or do you want to share your opinion? You can send us an e-mail using the following link: <a href="#" onclick="window.open(''#" onclick="window.open(''mailto:lingquest@languageininteraction.nl'',''_system''); return false;'',''_system''); return false;">synquiz@ languageininteraction.nl</a>.</p>
aboutScreenTextCbody=<p>LingQuest was developed within the research consortium <a href="#" onclick="window.open(''#" onclick="window.open(''http://www.languageininteraction.nl'',''_system''); return false;'',''_system''); return false;">Language in Interaction</a>, which aims to explain variation and similarities in languages as well as in linguistic skills. The consortium aims to gain understanding of how such a large range of (cultural) differences have arisen from a biological basis that is common to all people.</p><p>The research program examines human language from the level of genetics to interactions between conversational partners, addressing a diverse range of topics such as: brain structure and function, language development, evolution, multilingualism, speech production and comprehension, nonverbal behaviour, meaning and context, and the interplay of language with other cognitive systems (e.g. memory).</p>
aboutScreenTextDbody=<p>The research results of Language in Interaction are translated into applications for society in areas such as education and health. Currently a range of <a href="#" onclick="window.open(''#" onclick="window.open(''http://www.languageininteraction.nl/apps.html'',''_system''); return false;'',''_system''); return false;">language apps</a> are developed, including games.</p>
