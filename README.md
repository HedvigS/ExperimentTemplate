SynQuiz: A Grapheme Colour Synaesthesia App
=============================
This app will contain a playful test about synaesthesia. Synaesthesia is an interesting trait observed in about 4% of the general human population. For people with synaesthesia two or more senses appear to be interconnected; for example a synaesthete 'sees' particular colours when he or she thinks about certain characters or a concepts, such as letters, number, days of the week or months of the year.
