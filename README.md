LanguageMemoryApp
=================

Language Memory is a game where players learn about rare and exotic languages in the holdings of The Language Archive / Max-Planck-Institute for Psycholinguistics by listening to clips from the languages and matching clips of the same language. Combining a general interest in cultural diversity with a simple game interface has proven extremely popular with casual social gamers, as the popularity of ‘the Great Language Game’ has shown. This app improves these concepts by including a greater number of more diverse languages and collecting crucial data on players’ performance and linguistic backgrounds. The app offers links to more information on each language from a range of databases.
